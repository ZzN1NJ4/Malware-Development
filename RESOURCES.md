# Description

This will contain all the different Resources which I found in the wild & useful in my journey to understand Malware and Windows Internals and also some other low level stuffs as well.

It will also contain some cool tools that I have found in the wild.

`üå±` **Newbies**

If you are a totally beginner then, you should first get your hands dirty with some basics of computers & learn a programming language (preferrably low level language like C/C++). I won't recommmend starting with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> if you are a beginner (I can't express my love for Rust `ü¶Ä`, I just love it soo much alsdfjpawejsldfkufau).

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crr0ww">Crow</a> is a good YT channel to start afterwards.

Also, in this journey, there would be a lot(a really lot) of googling / reversing / smashing your head, etc. 

Stay Sane.
